## Welcome to libasm!
This is an exercise that consists of writing a small library in x86-64 assembly language, using Intel's syntax.
It's divided into the mandatory, and bonus parts:
  - The mandatory part introduced me to x86-64 (and assembly at large), and deals with basic concepts such as:
      the logic of x86, calling convention, function and system calls, PIC/PIE, and more.
  - The bonus part is comprised of more complicated functions. This means learning to manipulate data structures (notably, a linked list) at the assembly level. Whew.

### why i did it bla bla bla
Lately I've been interested in the "bare bones" of how computers work.
It seems to me that learning assembly language is a nice (and very satisfying) milestone in grasping the world of low-level computing.
[This article](https://cpu.land/) is a big part of what kindled my interest. Go read it, it's very cool.

Anyway, there it is, hope you enjoy :)
